# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build an MVP trust-first e-commerce platform (NISHQ) that prioritizes transparency and buyer certainty over sales optimization, featuring verified reviews, lifetime seller trust scores, honest pricing, and algorithm transparency.

**Planned changes:**
- Create landing page with hero section, trust signals, core explanation sections (why we exist, why different, how trust calculated, who it's for), and footer with transparency links
- Build product catalog/browsing page showing products in grid with trust indicators (seller trust score 0-100, account age, return %, fake review risk)
- Implement detailed product page with trust information above price, price breakdown without fake MRPs, verified reviews showing usage days and user history, seller transparency panel with lifetime metrics, and decision support sections (who should buy/avoid, trade-offs, return reasons)
- Create anxiety-free checkout page with clear escrow timelines, exact dates, and platform protection messaging
- Build admin panel for managing sellers (trust scores, history, violations), products (prices, images, decision support content), and verified reviews (usage days, user history badges)
- Implement dark mode variant with deep charcoal background, muted trust indicators, and fintech dashboard aesthetic
- Apply minimal, professional, authority-driven visual style with neutral colors (white, light grey, soft blue/green), strong typography, and mobile-first responsive layout across all pages
- Add algorithm transparency with visible explanations for each product recommendation
- Create backend data models and API endpoints for Sellers, Products, and Reviews with full CRUD operations
- Populate initial mock data with 3-5 sellers (varying trust scores 45-92), 10-15 products, and 20-30 verified reviews demonstrating the trust system

**User-visible outcome:** Users can browse a trust-focused e-commerce platform with transparent seller metrics, verified reviews, honest pricing, and clear decision support. Administrators can manage all sellers, products, and reviews through a backend panel. The platform demonstrates a complete trust-first shopping experience with no dark patterns or manipulative tactics.
